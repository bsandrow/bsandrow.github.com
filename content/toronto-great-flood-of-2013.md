Title: The Great Flood of 2013
Tags: Toronto, #floodto, #stormto, Flood

On July 8, 2013 during rush hour in Toronto, Canada, we received record
rainfall in a span of 2-3 hours. The totals were:

 * 123mm at Pearson International Airport
 * 91mm in Downtown Toronto
 * 82mm on Toronto Island

This caused massive amounts of flooding, backups in sewers and rain drains, and
power outages throughout the GTA.

I've gathered all of the photos, videos, Tweets, and stories that I find
interesting/relevant here. Apologies if it isn't super perfect, but it's later
and I'm off to bed. Email me with any corrections, updates, mistakes. I've
mostly done this for me, but if others find it useful, all the better.

## A couple of good news articles

 * [BlogTO article][42]
 * [storify](http://storify.com/blogto/toronto-weather-gets-wet-and-wild)
 * [Toronto Star article][36]. A couple of notes:
    - The video with the reporting saying "I'm a reporter with the Toronto
      Star" comes off as annoying. None of the people she's talking to seem
      very impressed with her being there.
    - The Mini Cooper making its way out of a flooded basement parking garage
      with water still pouring down the ramp, I haven't seen anywhere else.
